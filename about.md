I am a full stack Ruby on Rails developer that is continually increasing my knowledge of all technologies and programming techniques, including JavaScript, EmberJS, AngularJS, and Solr. I am currently working on a Mac and am generally comfortable in a Linux shell. Right now I am working remote and **love** it.
