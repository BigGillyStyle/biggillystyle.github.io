I am a full stack Ruby on Rails developer that is continually increasing my knowledge of all technologies and programming techniques, including JavaScript and AngularJS in particular. I am currently working on a Mac and am generally comfortable in a Linux shell (while still being far short of a system administrator). Right now I am working remote and **love** it.
