This is my **second** attempt at getting a blog going.  My first, more ambitious attempt, was a full-blown Rails app with MongoDB as a back-end and a SASS Bootstrap themed front-end.  Sigh...and at about that same time I got my first Rails job, which is causing me to have to work 11-12 hour days with about 1-2 hours of "awake time" at home each evening (which is mostly spent eating, talking with my wife about our day, and then prepping for work and exercise the next day).  Long story a little less long...now I'm trying out just using [Octopress](http://octopress.org), which greatly simplifies getting some content out there.

I'm learning plenty about full stack Rails and JavaScript development at work, so I don't need my blogging platform to be my "gateway" to my learning experience any more.  In fact, if all goes as planned (which it rarely does in life), then I can move on to implementing one of my "great business ideas"...and then using this simplified blogging platform to document my bumps and bruises along the way.  I promise no particular focus of this blog right now, as some days it may be technical in nature, and some days it may be these rambling personal thoughts.  It's a start.
